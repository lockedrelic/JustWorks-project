# Usage

To run the program locally, the input .csv file must be named ``` input.csv ``` , be in the given format such as the current example ``` input.csv ``` file, and be in the same folder as ``` main.py ```.
The program assumes there's no header row.

Open up the terminal and run 
``` 
python main.py 
```
Depending on the machine might need to use ```python3``` instead of ```python```.

The results will be in a file named ```output.csv```.
